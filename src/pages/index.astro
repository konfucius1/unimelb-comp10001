			COMP10001 is an introductory computer science subject that teaches students with little to no
			prior programming experience the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python
			language. It is a prerequisite for the Computing and Software Systems and Data Science major,
			but is also suitable as a breadth subject for students in other disciplines.
		</p>

		<p>The key topics covered include:</p>
		<ul class="mt-4 list-disc pl-6">
			<li>Fundamental programming constructs like loops, conditionals, Functions</li>
			<li>Basic data structures like arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.</li>
			<li>Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking</li>
			<li>Program design, implementation, and debugging</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="mt-4">
			Through this subject, students learn essential programming skills that are applicable across
			various fields like chemistry, physics, engineering, and data analysis. The subject aims to
			build a strong foundation in programming concepts and problem-solving abilities.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4">
			The subject is designed to be self-paced, with online resources like coding exercises and
			projects that allow students to learn at their own pace. The assessments typically involve
			coding projects that reinforce the concepts learned.
