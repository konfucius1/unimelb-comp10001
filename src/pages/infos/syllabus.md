## Subject Description

COMP10002 Foundations of Algorithms is designed to reinforce your programming skills and computing knowledge. In it, you will learn the language C, and how C programs are structured, compiled, and managed. At the same time, the subject is about algorithms, the fundamental building blocks of computation. Topics include dynamic data structures, the algorithms that manipulate them (lists, trees, hash tables), searching algorithms including pattern searching, and sorting algorithms. You are expected to develop your own ability to synthesize algorithmic approaches, and to evaluate problems and computational tasks in terms of what algorithmic techniques might be applicable.
